{% questions %}
* Can I get more comfortable with that whole range of happiness, and can I get more comfortable being anywhere on that scale?
* [What happens if I practice more metta meditation and get in the habit of imagining abundant happiness?](/2023/02/22/experiment/metta-conversation/)
* [Can I be vulnerable first, in conversation, and lay out some of my open questions for other people â€“ not only to model the behavior, but also because I would really like to hear what they have to say?](/2023/02/22/experiment/questions-aloud/)
* [What happens if I am more deliberate about asking people what is good in their lives, and trying to find what is resonating from that more positive side?](/2023/02/22/experiment/asking-good/)
