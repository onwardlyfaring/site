{% intentions %}
Run three parallel experiments about happiness during lent, based on the three specific questions I asked in [Distant Conversations](/distant-conversations/):
* [What happens if I practice more metta meditation and get in the habit of imagining abundant happiness?](/experiment/metta-conversation/)
* [Can I be vulnerable first, in conversation, and lay out some of my open questions for other people â€“ not only to model the behavior, but also because I would really like to hear what they have to say?](/experiment/questions-aloud/)
* [What happens if I am more deliberate about asking people what is good in their lives, and trying to find what is resonating from that more positive side?](/experiment/asking-good/)
{% endintentions %}
{% questions %}
* Can I get more comfortable with that whole range of happiness, and can I get more comfortable being anywhere on that scale?
* How much of my discontent with conversations stems from this thing that can be mistaken for begrudging people their happiness? What is actually going on here?
