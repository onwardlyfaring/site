{% intentions %}
In conversations with my friends, actively ask about what is good in their lives.
{% endintentions %}
{% questions %}
* Can we have conversations that are deep because they describe? What does back-and-forth engagement look like there, what does coming to describe together look like?
* Are intentions to problem solve at odds with intentions to appreciate what is good?
* Are there different conversational modes around "appreciating" vs "feeling blessed"?
