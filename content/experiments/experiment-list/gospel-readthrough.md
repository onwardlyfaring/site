{% intentions %}
I have strangely little familiarity with the Bible. I'm always surprised when I recognize passages. Even though I often hear biblical text in church or at morning prayer, it usually slips in one ear and out the other, and I've done very little Bible study. I'm not too concerned about this fact, to be honest; one day I hope to do more serious scriptural study, but that time doesn't have to be now. At this juncture, though, I do think it would do me good to know what we talk about Jesus as having said. The four Gospels of the Second Testament are not very long, and it seems a fitting Lenten practice to read a little bit of them each day.

{% questions %}
* What does Jesus say about wealth, work, and concern with accumulation?
* What does Jesus say about religious law?
* Does my understanding of biblical Jesus match better to the evangelical understanding of Jesus or the progressive Christian one? In what ways is biblical Jesus reminiscent of each?
* Are there passages in the four Gospels that will surprise me?
* Do I like the Gospels?

#### 2023-02-23 | Matthew 1-3 | The Jewish Annotated New Testament & Remembering The Historical Jesus 
I'm reading  from Levine and Brettler's _The Jewish Annotated New Testament_, which I received as a Christmas gift from one of my housemates last year. I didn't think too much about this choice at first -- it was clear to me that I wanted some guiding text as I read, and this book is just what I have on hand. But there's a little more to it; I suspect that reading from the Bible in such a deliberate way would not even have crossed my mind if I did not have this Jewish-annotated version. Bible-reading feels strangely associated with evangelicalism to me; I do not feel particularly comfortable with Bibles as a whole, whereas this book feels much more comfortable.


But that means that I'm reading, well, Jewish annotations while I read the Gospel text. Which is great! There's lots of context that I'm glad to have. But it's also more jarring than I was expecting. There's a first box of additional content entitled "The Virgin Birth" which, after discussing the relevant Hebrew and Greek vocabulary, goes on to say 
> Traditional Christian readings favor a reference to a miraculous conception. However, some interpreters argue that Matthew was not speaking of a literal conception that took place apart from sexual intercourse. Others propose that Matthew borrowed from pagan traditions, in which a male god engages in intercourse with a human woman (cf. Gen 6.1-4); or that the tradition of miraculous conception arose in order to explain what would otherwise be seen as an illegitimate conception; still others see behind Matthew's accoutn a midrash similar to Jewish ones concerning the miraculous birth of Moses. (4)

I... woah. I exist in Christian circles where no one is really suggesting that there was a miraculous conception, and also in circles where people are pretty delighted to talk about historical, linguistic, and theological context. But I have not actually ever heard anyone talk about _why_ our tradition describes a miraculous conception, except maybe to gloss over the relationship with Moses. Certainly I have not heard anyone suggest that the alternative was an illegitimate conception!

More generally, I've never paid attention to discussions of the Historical Jesus; they seemed uninteresting and more or less pointless to me. I'm Christian because I find that these stories and this tradition capture something important about the world, enough that I feel under-their-claim, somehow, and will be living in dialogue with them. In college in particular I was big into historicity not being truth; indeed, an understanding of poetical truth, truth which is not simply accuracy, was a vital step in my coming to identify myself as a Christian. But damn. Do I then end up believing something like, yes the Messiah has come, but no, uh, it wasn't really _Jesus of Nazareth_? Yes, God has become incarnate, and we can think about all the implications of that... but no, no, uh, not in _that_ guy? (at least not any more than in anyone else.) Because those sentences sound really stupid, even to me. Like, shoot, what do I do about the fact that there really was a Jewish dude in early A.D. who was baptized and crucified? Which, yikes, somehow I feel very weak right now, and like I probably have been decieving myself a long time, but I also feel dissatisfied with my options. Like this is a moment of real naivety; I have no idea what I'm talking about. 

##### Other notes
 * I'd love to hear what more people have to say re: the ways in which Jesus is set out as a new Moses, but also as superior to Moses (??)

Matthew 1: 
 * Jesus as "God saves"; Emmanuel as "God with us"; and the ways in which salvation and God's presence are the same thign and different things
 * I don't know enough about the destruction of the Temple
 * There was an annotation that just explained the Holy Spirit as "God's creative and enduring presence" and... yes, yes indeed. It was funny to me that the phrase could be explained so bluntly and succinctly. 
* "Jews traditionally saw salvation as part of the covenant... and understood continuing divine presence to be part of the ideal future" - I had never actually put these different perspectives on salvation side-by-side before. Feels like there's a lot more here.
* All this fulfilling-what-had-been-spoken-by-the-prophets stuff is weird to me. An annotation says that in context the references don't even make sense. This doesn't feel uncomfortable to me, though, it just makes me want to go back and re-read Armstrong's _The Lost Art of Scripture_.

Matthew 2:
* Matthew has a negative view of Jerusalem
* The star really is kind of strange and sweet 
* I almost would not have been able to tell you all this about the Magi and King Herod and little Jesus going to Egypt  and the Massacre of the Innocents

Matthew 3: 
* This chapter, and especially the baptism of Jesus, I found so powerful.
* John the Baptist eating "locusts  and wild honey" feels so symbolically rich, it's beautiful and powerful and kind of wild. Judgement, desolation, promise, abundance, I don't even know. 
* I had a sense of not totally getting what was going on... like, did Pharisees and Sudducees want to get baptized? I looked it up online later (lol) and the uhhh [hermeneutics.stackexchange.com answer](https://hermeneutics.stackexchange.com/questions/32419/were-the-pharisees-baptized-by-john) is no, they were just coming to check out the baptizing, and that John's invective has almost an edge of sarcasm. But idk about that either. There is, indeed, a lot I feel like I am missing, which is honestly kind of relieving. 
* I even love this statement, that John the Baptist baptizes with water for repentance, but that another wil come to baptize with the Holy Spirit and fire. Repentence on the one hand, purification on the other. The drama of that phrasing, burning the chaff with unquenchable fire seems fitting for John here, and it seems grand and high-stakes and helpful. (It doesn't read to me as too scary, though that's only because I've had enough liberal-progressive-Episcopalians vision through this text for me.)
* Jesus getting baptized is one of the few things historians think actually happened, in part because it is kind of strange for Jesus to be baptized by John for repentance if he's divine. I don't really know what to make of this, but I do like it. It feels like it starts him off from this more obviously human place.
