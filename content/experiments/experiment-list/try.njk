<h2>Read through the Gospels</h2>

<h3>Intentions</h3>
<p>
I have strangely little familiarity with the Bible. I'm always surprised when I recognize passages. Even though I often hear biblical text in church or at morning prayer, it usually slips in one ear and out the other, and I've done very little Bible study. I'm not too concerned about this fact, to be honest; one day I hope to do more serious scriptural study, but that time doesn't have to be now. At this juncture, though, I do think it would do me good to know what we talk about Jesus as having said. The four Gospels of the Second Testament are not very long, and it seems a fitting Lenten practice to read a little bit of them each day.

<h3>Questions</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li>What does Jesus say about wealth, work, and concern with accumulation?</li>
<li>Does my understanding of biblical Jesus match better to the evangelical understanding of Jesus or the progressive Christian one? In what ways is biblical Jesus reminiscent of each?</li>
<li>Are there passages in the four Gospels that will surprise me?</li>
</ul>
