typically, i try to commit to the projects i take on: either i'm going to see the project fully through, or i should stop working on it at all, at least for the moment. but my housemates want to learn spanish as a house this summer. the reasons are good and heartwarming: a spanish-english church is starting next door, and we want to offer hospitality to them. and we have, at some level, a means: our own church is looking to fund independent educational efforts for young people. but our levels vary from i-had-30-minutes-of-spanish-a-week-in-third-grade to i-took-ap-spanish-but-that-was-ten-years-ago, and no one is willing to put in more than an hour or two a week. i considered learning spanish more intensely on my own, but i don't actually want to do that. so, instead of withdrawing myself from the activity all together, i'm going to try going with the flow, and try joining the project half-heartedly. i can't imagine that this won't be a waste of time, but perhaps i'll be surprised.</div>
