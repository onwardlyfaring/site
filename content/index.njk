<h2> Hello! </h2>

<p> Welcome to my fledgling site. I don't yet know what will be constructed here: cathedral, carousel, small-cozy home? I look forward, though, to shaping it, and I look forward to letting it shape me. This is a long-term project. I partake in it with commitment and heart. </p>

<p> This site is here to 
    
    in tending to this site, is that it will give ground to the processes of acting and thinking. 

    
    In my vision, this site is present to whole idea lifecycles. 
    
    It gives space for me to notice, to read, to think, to write, to dialogue, and to act. Ideas can accerete and tangle and come to seed; through articulation and discussion, they can be clarified and grow; and they can be lived out.  
    
    Sitting with ideas lets them seed. Idea-seeds that tangle and accrete and are cared for, grow. Articulating and formalizing thoughts clarifies them. And bringing ideas to dialogue and action 
    
In tending to this website, I hope to create processes that encourage me 

In tending to this website, I hope to tend to a commitment to myself to think and to act
 I hope that , that they will grow as I formalize them, and that I can sustain dialogue with others -- you? -- in the world. </p>

Ah, God, don't lose your balance. Even he
who loves you and in darkness still can see
and know your face, when like a wavering light
he feels your breath, does not possess you quite.
And if at night by some one you are guessed,
so that you're forced to come into his prayer:
    you're still the guest
    that onwardly will fare.
