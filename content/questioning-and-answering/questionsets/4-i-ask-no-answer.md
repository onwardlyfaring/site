    <p>some open questions</p>
    <ul>
      <li>How can I be more in tune with what other people need and are looking for, so that I address their problems?</li>
      <li>How can I hold myself together when I'm tired? how can I see being tired as an opportunity to practice being healthy?</li>
      <li>How do I talk about and orient to the scripts/expectations/whatnot that are "in the air"? </li>

      <li>How can I encourage others more?</li>
      <li>How do I hold my own ambition while still taking joy in the present?</li>
      <li>How do I orient around my religious commitments in the context of my interfaith relationship?</li>
      <li>How much of my life am I willing to give up to doing work I donâ€™t care about, under the guise that I am learning skills from it and becoming more ready to do something else?</li>
      <li>How do I become more comfortable and strong in believing what I believe and desiring what I desire?</li>
