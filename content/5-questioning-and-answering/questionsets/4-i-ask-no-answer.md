<h3>I ask the questions, but they remain unanswered</h3>
    <p>some open questions</p>
    <ul>
      <li>In what sense can there be reified ethical principles? Why does striving to be good, or to make the world good, so often seem like the wrong framing, or a framing that can lead us astray? What does a human-scale ethics look like today? (And if Bonhoeffer has relevant ideas: is there any way they can be translated to a natural-theology framing?)</li>
      <li>Can we apply techniques used for individual addiction to systems addiction? (Think Alan Carr's <i>Easy Way to Quit Smoking</i> but for capitalist exploitation.)</li>
      <li>Is an unsentimental religion possible? desirable? What is the relationship between unsentimental engagement, engagement with reality itself, and neutral engagement?</li>
      <li>What works universally, what needs to be specified differently for different archetypes, and what must be perfectly particular? (Think sweeping statements about the human condition vs personality-specific advice.) What are the implications for philosophy & psychology, as disciplines? What are the implications for finding e.g. necessary-and-sufficient-conditions for the audience of a book? What are the implications for thoughtful marketing?</li>
      <li>Why am I so happy to say that God came to earth as a human, but so reluctant to say that some particular human was God? Is the resistance just from an epistemological habit?</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <li>How do I orient around my religious commitments in the context of my interfaith relationship?</li>
      <li>How do I build a career that engages my analytical side and my interpersonal/thoughtful side in a unified way?</li>
      <li>How can I encourage others more?</li>
      <li>What would it look like to practice instant action more often?</li>
    </ul>
