intentionAbstract: Deliberately ask some of my open questions in conversations with people I trust, seeking object-level discussion about their topics, rather than meta-level commentary. 
questionAbstract: What kind of context do I need to give in order to give other people a hook into these things that I'm thinking about?

{% intentions %}
On Thursdays, identify a conversation I have scheduled for the week ahead, look at my list of open questions, and choose a question to bring up near the start of the conversation. (Be willing to be flexible with this.)
{% endintentions %}
{% questions %}

* How do I genuinely ask people to comment on these things I think about and care about? (Rather than just hint at what I'm thinking about, but closing down object-level discussion of it.)
* What kind of context do I need to give in order to have relevant object-level discussion? Just the question is probably not it. Do I have to frame specific problems? Specific observations?

{% endquestions %}
{% notes %}

* 2022-02-23: This seems actually scary now that I'm writing it down explicitly, which I wasn't expecting.
