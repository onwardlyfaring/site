{% intentions %}
Regularly practice lovingkindness via

* [Tasshin's Metta Squad recordings](https://tasshin.com/metta-recordings/) and other guided meditations on the [Metta App](https://metta-app.com/)
* The adapted lovingkindness phrases I pray on Anglican prayer beads

Practice loosely, perhaps half of the days during lent, for an amount of time that seems right. I'm just trying to get a sense of what this practice is like, rather than really committing to anything.
{% endintentions %}
{% questions %}

* How can I dissolve the blocks where my own insecurity impacts my ability to receive others where they are at?
* Does adding in deliberate lovingkindness practice actually help me be more loving day-to-day? Why or why not?
* Should I consider practicing metta meditation in a more committed way in the future?

{% endquestions %}
{% notes %}

* 2023-02-23: Listened to Tasshin's "Write someone a Metta Letter" while folding laundry. I felt sort of silly not being in a meditative posture, and I didn't actually write a letter, but it felt good to scope out that I'm holding this experiment broadly and lightly. It was so easy to love my easy-to-love-person, and I felt a sort of brimming-over with it. When I love myself, I love the aspects of God incarnate in me, my particularity, even when it is troubled particularity. When I love others, I love the aspects of God incarnate in them, their particularity, even when it is troubled particularity. It is delightful that we can be different, and it is delightful that God can show up in us in these different ways. I had sort of forgotten about this, but I was reminded of it.
* 2023-02-26: Meditated listening to Tasshin's "Exploring Heartspaces." I had trouble with the heartspaces visualization (although I liked the idea of it), and I wonder if I'll have a different experience if I come back to it. I found myself pulled towards imagining the person-I-feel-connected-to really flourishing, being really happy, in a way that felt powerful.
