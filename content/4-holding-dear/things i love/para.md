I didn't want Tiago Forte's book _Building a Second Brain_ to be helpful; but alas, it was. Most strikingly, Forte suggests a way of organizing your computer filesystem (or notes, or Google Drive, or whatever) that he acronyms PARA. It is such a direct suggestion: he is almost giving you a task, not a project. Like literally he is just saying what the root folders of your filesystem should be: Projects, Areas, Resources, Archive. It takes a little thought and iteration actually implement, if you need to to figure out what all your projects and areas etc are, but the actual organizational system is simply prescribed.

After reading _Building a Second Brain_, I did actually reformat all of my various drives into this form -- folders for projects in the projects folder, etc -- and my digital quality of life has gone up immensely. I can find things without search now. Everything is just magically where I want it to be. It requires way less maintenance than any other organizational system I've tried. And it IS a system: it is self-consistent, non-trivially so, the way one would hope a system would be.

Anyways, unless your use case is super niche, maybe check out some of Tiago Forte's blog posts on [PARA](https://fortelabs.com/blog/para/), or read his book for a broader introduction.
