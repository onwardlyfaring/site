RAIN is a technique -- I think it is meant to be a meditation, but I use it as a journalling exercise -- that is one of the two things I've found that can reliably calm me down when I am feeling so stressed, anxious, or overwhelmed that I don't know what to do with myself. Very consistently, if I write through the four steps (Recognize, Allow, Investigate, Non-Identification) I reach a point where a thin layer of wonder and gratitude that I get to live through all these rich experiences floats to just within my grasp. I usually still feel all the feelings I was feeling before, but instead of having topline meta-angst, I have something closer to topline meta-equanimity, and I'm much more prepared to go take action in the world.

How I do this: when my feelings are feeling Too Big, or when I notice that I'm feeling very stuck and unable to get anything done, I often remember RAIN, and turn to a blank page.

First, I take an inventory of what I'm feeling: as emotions rise up, I write them down, along with any reasons or other explanation that I want to get out of my head and onto the page. This is how I often journal, but I try to name the emotions explicitly: I'm feeling cranky, insecure, embarassed, nervous, tired - whatever. This is the R - Recognize what is happening - and a little bit of the I - Investigate inner experience.

When I start to lose steam on describing my current state, I start a new paragraph. For each emotion I identified prior, I write a sentence about how it is okay to be feeling that emotion. I also often write sentences about how the reasons I'm feeling the emotions are okay, or the messy situations that are precipitating all the angst are okay. It is by constructing these sentences that they become true to me: it is by telling myself that I am A - Allowing life to be just as it is - that I do in fact allow life to be just as it is. I resist my current state less. Usually by this point I've done plenty of the I - Investigate inner experience - and don't feel called to do more, but sometimes it helps to dig in to what's going on and what I might want to do about it. Sometimes in the process of allowing the first batch of feelings, a whole other batch of feelings rises, and I repeat the recognize/allow cycle until it feels like I've gotten everything out.

The final step, N - Non-identification - is my favorite. It is what I never knew I needed but always do seem to need; and it works much better after doing the recognizing and investigating and allowing. In a new paragraph, I write sentences to remind myself that I am not identical with my emotions, that I am the awareness underneath them experiencing them. Once again, through the writing of these sentences, I come to see them as true.
