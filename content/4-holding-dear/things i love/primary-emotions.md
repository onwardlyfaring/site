This activity is a highly-structured check-in for talking through emotions, alone or in a group. The structure helps people share what they're feeling and why in a surprisingly concise and straightforward way. I have found that it gives useful questions for self-understanding when used alone. In a group, it can be an effective an respectful way to check in, but it is likely only worth doing as a grounding for another activity that is _even more intense_.

Here's how I was first introduced to the activity. Have a group sit or stand in a circle. Give each person a "Primary Emotions Card" which lists five primary emotions and a sentence parsing out that emotion - for example, SADNESS: I LOST it (There's something I need to _let go_ of.). The first person in the circle says what emotion (of the five listed) they are feeling 'on top' and use the given sentence to help parse out the feeling -- e.g., if they identify sadness, then they give name to what they've lost or need to let go of. Then, with that top layer cleared, they say what emotion is under that, and parse it out the same way. They continue with further layers of emotions until they're done, and the next person in the circle can begin.

When I first did this activity, I was terrified of it: it seemed an incredibly intimate activity to do with a group of people, mostly because there's nowhere to hide - you have to say _why_ you're feeling what you're feeling. But it has grown on me. For one, it is somewhat less invasive than it seems: every part of this activity is optional, and besides that, people are usually good at sketching an overview of the objects of their feelings without too much detail - it is part of what makes this activity quite nice. Second, I have used it only in contexts where it was used as a check-in before another intense conversation, often at interfaith dialogue retreats. In these contexts, it felt not at all like vulnerability bonding (which I am skeptical of) - if anything, the conversations that would follow had more of this forced bonding. Instead, this check-in made it very clear that we were all coming to the table in different circumstance, with different capacities, and it opened us to compassion and spaciousness. It was a privilege, as a group, to get to hold intentionally and gently the feelings of sadness or anger that people were feeling under the surface about unrelated events, that might not have been mentioned otherwise.

And then, the actual activity of naming emotions and locating objects was surprisingly helpful. There was a period where I often would look at this card on my own and talk myself through it. It doesn't matter that I don't really believe that these five emotions are particularly primary, or that I doubt that the given sentences really can or do parse the emotion. When I am angry, it actually is just helpful to recognize that I am angry, and to ask myself if there is a boundary I need to protect or restore. It usually gets me to the heart of what's going on and how I can be kind to myself faster than almost anything else.
