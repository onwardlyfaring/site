## february 16: relaxing back into feeling

when brahms’s geistliches lied op. 30 comes on, i can feel myself relax back. an exhalation — my eyes close for a moment, and i let the trembling turbulence inside of myself drift to the surface, into feeling. a release of tension; an awareness of what tension there is yet to be released. in that pause, i realize some of how i feel. i notice how tired i am, how grateful i am. i am supported by the strains of this sacred song.

i have been learning how to posture myself in this way — how to lean back into feeling. i have a lot to learn. there is a kind of stress that hangs in my body long after the stressor is gone, because i have not yet faced it, bid it a careful goodbye, and shown it to the door. but again: i am learning; i will learn.

it is hard, sometimes, to be vulnerable to yourself. it can be scary to feel anything at all, for fear that the floodgates of emotion will open and overwhelm you. but feeling acutely, properly is not only important and healthy and relieving: it can open you into the sacred. never does presence itself seem so near, then when i am aware of myself alive and breathing and full of emotion.
