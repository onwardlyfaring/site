## march 12: pacing of 18.901

i wrote about my topology class at the start of the semester: it was crushingly silent, dead, incoherent. but as the semester has paced itself forward, topology lectures have gotten more and more bearable. we started turning on the lights, instead of having lecture in darkness; i learned how to watch the board, and tune out the professor, so that i could go through the material at my own pace. and then i was invested, and the material got more interesting, and suddenly the lectures were paced perfectly, so that i could actually pay full attention.

the professor, i have realized, is literally pacing his lectures off of my facial expressions. he moves to the next topic as soon as i smile; he pauses, for a moment, if i look confused; and if i continue to look confused, he will stare at me until i ask him a question. it is like he is giving the lecture directly to me, and fourteen other people just happen to be in the room.

sometimes i think things like this, and i’m not sure that they are true. there are narratives to be drawn, and some are funny enough that they stick, even if they don’t quite line up with reality. but this? i mean, i can’t see the expressions of the people in the other rows, and perhaps he has attended to the sense of the class more generally. but really, i mean it: i think this professor is pacing his lectures off of the ways i smile and frown.
