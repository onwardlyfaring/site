## august 17: to be in the city

sit down and there’s the scent of lavender. look around — there’s lavender all over; growing. close enough to touch. — it had been a long time since i’d laid eyes on a lavender plant.

open the door; and the the rich sound of an organ surrounds you, enveloping you. a domed hall, filled with sculptures; a crucifix. — it had been a long time since i’d heard an organ play.

to be in the city, and to find yourself alone. to act on an impulse and stumble into the sacred. some emotional states require spontaneity. some places you don’t know till you’ve wandered through them.
sitting cross-legged on the floor in front of anna oppermann’s installation, “being a housewife”; look at the drawings and look at the plants and look at the little silver pins in the tablecloths. alone in the exhibition gallery; another kind of intimacy.

be glad your backpack was checked at the front. exposed and light —. you’re vulnerable here, you’re raw; close to the art and close to the lavender.
