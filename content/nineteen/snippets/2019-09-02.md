a kind of pride. — there is a skill i am learning.

have an idea; make it reality. — come home after hours and hours of talking, and sit quietly, sewing.

needle through fabric, thread looping around itself. it may be my head is cloudy, it may be i don’t have another word in me. but this is a different activity. the repetition — (though, up, around; through, up, around) — is relieving. i don’t need a word i cannot give.

something inside myself, different. something inside myself, private. here is what i can do alone; in a moment of rest.
