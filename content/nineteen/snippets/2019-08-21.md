a shirt, brushing against the back of my arm; and the fabric is light, lightweight; i haven’t felt the solidity of his body; yet the fabric is warm; warm because he is a body radiating heat. we don’t make eye contact. but i know where his body is and i know it is warm; know these things in my arms.

there’s a scent i have loved for years and i’m smelling it now. i can’t figure out where it is coming from; there are so many bodies here; but it doesn’t matter, i just feel happy; happy just to smell it.

i forget how much bodies matter to me. my body; many bodies; in the crowd.

this summer, i have reckoned with this body of mine. have tried to inhabit her. cared so fiercely about feeling the muscles inside of me. learned to hold her as more precious. i don’t want to hold stress in my body, the way i have; and i am learning to attend to that space between the emotional and the physical. it has been good work; important work. but here now a reminder; that we all are embodied; that embodiment is not just a way of being inside myself; and how rich experience can be, that we all are embodied. —  i am aware of the bodies of the people around me.

i walk home and the summer night is quiet and warm and i think of holding his hand; think of his body, close to mine.
