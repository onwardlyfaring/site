## april 24: a pointsettia, a shrub

a poinsettia. — i had assumed it would die on its own, but it has lived. when i asked my mother, she told me, indeed, she has vague recollections of poinsettias-being-thrown-out. but here i am: me and a hardy plant, four months after christmas.

she’s flourishing. red leaves dropped, she is alive and full and green. stems hardening, branching: i had not quite realized that pointsettia are shrubs. and i wonder just how woody this stalk of hers will get.

and if she looks a little strange on my windowsill, it’s just because her pot is still adorned in that festive red foil. i have not kept her up-to-date with the seasons: but then again, must we always be on trend?

there’s a slight revulsion i feel toward this dear plant; and yet i appreciate her, and i admire her, and i cannot imagine getting rid of her. she feels like me in a way the ficus fig tree and the little basil sprout do not.

and i wonder sometimes if i am mistaken about myself, the way i have been mistaken about her. — if there are brightly-colored leaves in me, i have misidentified as flowers; if i am a shrub i have misidentified as an herb. if there is a woodiness in me that time will uncover.
