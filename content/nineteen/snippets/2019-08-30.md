## august 30: the prince's tale

there’s a kind of love that can lead you astray. or maybe it isn’t the love itself; maybe it is the situation; maybe it is you within the situation. (causality is an unwieldy beast.) — there’s a way of moving through the world, in which you attribute action to a feeling you identify as love; action which is not good.

but is the love corrupt, or are you? — sometimes i think that goodness is a constitutive standard of love. if love is bad — if love is obsessive or sharp: it isn’t love, it is pseudo-love. if actions are manifesting, to control or harm: you lack respect: you do not love.

he says, he is sorry to hear that i did not feel cared for, but that nonetheless, he cared about me. he says, he cared about me but it hurt; he says, he didn’t understand why something that was supposed to be good, felt so bad. he says, he held me in the wrong regard.

was his care legitimate, and it was just the scaffolding around that care that failed? — or was it not care at all?

he found himself astray.
