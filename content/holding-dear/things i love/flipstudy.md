FlipStudy is supposedly a flashcard app. It is, alas, not a very good flashcard app - but it is an excellent and cozy home for text writ large. I'm delighted now to have a place on my phone that will show me a screen that is just a nice color and the words, "I know it's not done yet, but I already like it" or the full text of Whitman's "A noiseless patient spider."

FlipStudy's interface is simple: it trying to simulate a stack of index cards, without adding additional functionality. The main screen is just blocks of color with the titles of my decks, and tapping into one gives a sequence of cards. There are no buttons. There is no guiding text. When going through cards, I see essentially nothing that I myself did not put in the app. Correspondingly, the interface for adding cards is clunky - lots of swiping up to see the menus that allow me to edit or reorder or change the color of cards - and as far as I can tell it all has to be done on mobile, with no shortcuts. But that's fine; I rarely want to add or edit cards, now that I've done the basic setup. For me, FlipStudy can be just a simple, lovely home for poems and affirmations.

The only other downside of the app is that the app icon is busy-looking and says, like, E=mc^2. But this is easily remedied: I have a shortcut called "Calm Words" set up on my iPhone that just opens the app, and I put an icon for the shortcut (rather than for the app itself) on my home screen, so the whole experience now is very cozy.
