## projects, finished and in progress

### on growing up: projects from college

- [exploring the neighborhood](/exploring-the-neighborhood/): a senior year essay. written for a literature class on nature writing that became the central activity of my life when the pandemic hit; about annie dillard and the town i grew up in and birds and what it means to be human.
- [snippets](/nineteen/): junior year collection of little pieces. every day january-september 2019 i wrote a few hundred words of creative non-fiction and posted it on my [instagram](https://instagram.com/onwardlyfaring).
- [drupelets](/drupelets/): sophomore year newsletters. the original source of the blackberry drawing used on this site. i wrote issues anonymously and would drop ~30 paper copies in the hallways of mit each tuesday night.
- [semester i](/semester-i/0/) & [semester ii](/semester-ii/0/): freshman year zines. included not because i am proud of them (indeed, it is uncomfortable to look back on them!) but to honor what it was to be seventeen and overwhelmed and trying to figure things out.

### daily reminder emails

### spotify data analysis

### a quilt or two

### on the internet

- [neocities site](https://onwardlyfaring.neocities.org/): created in autumn 2020, a personal website intended to capture the vibe of my college dorm room. i loved making the auto-regenerating (and admittedly inaccessible) voronoi home page and an assortment of other small pages.
- [this site](/this-site/): linked are some reflections on what i'm up to with this present site!
