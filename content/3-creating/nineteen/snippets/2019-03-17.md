# march 17: lydia, lydia

grinning stupidly. everything inside of me full — no, brimming: brimming out into this unshakable cheerfulness, the kind of delight that is almost vapid for the degree to with it inheres so persistently inside of you — feeling, dear feeling, even without thought or understanding. what emotions can come to pass within us!

and if there is explanation i can feed myself now, i did not hunger for explanation then. overtaking gratitude: for the threads, spun and pulled, that enabled the evening to go the way it did — but also grateful in a wide, wide sense, that it is possible to be oriented in the world in this way. for an emotion that sat in me so silly — it also sat in me so well-grounded.

one kind of radiance shifts into another; it matures as it cycles; it radiates in and out, and you are filled, and you are light, and you are grounded.
