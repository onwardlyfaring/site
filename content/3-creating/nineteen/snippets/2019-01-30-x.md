<!-- # january 30: the bad ideas ball -->

to be open to a possibility; to achieve that possibility; to have the outcome of the achievement not be what you had been open to at all.

there is a gap between what we will, and what our actions are, and that gap scares me. because: what happens when you end up in situations you had not been targeting for at all? — some situations, you would choose to not enter, but it is unclear if you should choose to exit them: the calculation changes; the activation energy is in a different place. and if you are mired in action, it is hard, sometimes, to step back and think at all.

it may be true that you are surprised at the situation in which you have ended up. but that surprise is not necessarily surprise at oneself: after all, as i am describing it, you didn’t quite choose to end up here at all. however, observations of how you continue to act — in this state in which you are not quite sure how much you are willing actively — may be surprising also; and those are surprises of the self.

is the only time you can surprise yourself a situation in which you are on the border between voluntary and involuntary action?
