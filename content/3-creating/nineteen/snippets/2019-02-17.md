i miss feeling the care that pressed up under my ribcage. bones and muscle and skin —gentle and insistent. the kind of care that asked something of me — a kind of care that grounded me.  

its requests were real, and they were heavy, but they were not obtrusive: how could they obtrude, when the whole complex of feelings and reasons was already inside of me, gathered up in the soft tissue of my interior? it was like he wasn’t entirely outside of me, anymore. however he would react, whatever he would choose to do — his feeling was already resting in my abdomen. (—pressing, soft.) i have never known tenderness so genuinely as i did with him.

to be well-matched, to share. if i did not understand him, i embraced him; if he did not understand me, he embraced me. i was supporting; i was being ontologically supported. it always surprised me to find our built commons under that shallow-seeming symmetry.

after all this, it still feels like there’s a small, him-shaped lump in my liver. that the connection between us, made tenuous now by the long miles and silence between us, has not broken. and i wonder if time will wear it away; and i wonder what it would mean if time did not.

but this i know: there’s more reality to be built working in concert than working alone.
