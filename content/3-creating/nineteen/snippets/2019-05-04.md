## may 4: needles & potentiality

to hold potentiality as a state in itself is easier on some days than on others. — inflated and floating, and it’s soft and round and warm; but on some days you imagine it starting to burst, you imagine the skin of it peeling away, and the air inside pouring out, and in your head you can see the air pouring out, you can see the texture of it, silvery and fluid and it reminds you of an illusion, and it reminds you of the heat in the desert, wavering; and the rest of the skin crumples, and you don’t even have to imagine it falling to the ground to get that closure. oh yes: on some days, it is very hard to hold potentiality as a state in itself, because there are needles that you carry around in your pocket, there’s power in your pocket, and you know, at any moment, you could puncture the potentiality itself, if you wanted to, you could watch it crumple, pink and pathetic, to the floor, and it would be tragic, and it would be over, all over.

you go through the day and your hands are in your pocket, and you run your fingers over the needles, mindless, because they are small and smooth and stiff, and the pad of your fingertip bumps up against the point of the needle, takes stock of how sharp the needle is, and your hand is satisfied, because the point didn’t break your skin, because it was dull enough that you could get some interest, some sensation, from pressing your fingertip against it, into it, and you do it again, and you never notice you aren’t invincible. your fingertips find the eye of the needle, and if you press your fingers into it, you can feel the edges of that little hole, even though you cannot let your fingers meet though that little hole. — and so through the whole day, even if you aren’t thinking about anything at all, your fingertips are, your fingertips are exploring, they are gaining mastery, they will not forget these needles, and their little silver shafts, and their barely-legible eyes, and their points that surely are sharp enough to burst that inflated potentiality but are not sharp enough to hurt you. oh, there’s an arrogance in the knowledge of your fingertips, because your fingertips claim to understand.
