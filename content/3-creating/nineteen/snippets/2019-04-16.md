# april 16: from the inside

some change has to come from the inside.

mired in incoherence: the cares in her heart pull in opposite directions, and she is torn apart. she reads stories of others who have been in her situation, and she feels seen; and then she reaches the point in the story where the author resolves the contradiction, and she is crestfallen. she is not ready to let go of either side of this inconsistency, not yet. advice is intolerable. when it directly addresses the question, it takes a stance: it supposes one half, and obliterates the other. — but she sees the symmetry, and she cannot break it. her heart is split and confused.

it is not a matter for the iron of subjective rationality. it is a choice she will come to make: a choice only she can come to make.

he is submerged in his own emotion. frameworks so well-formed: every perception, every word is filtered through this view. distortion, everywhere: but his anxiety insists it is not the problem, and he is convinced by it. but his anxiety has not convinced me. and i wonder if a cognitive shift would help, and i wonder if there are other frameworks he could employ, that would help him to be well. but it’s a thought too familiar. as much as i talk about posturing and orientation: i cannot, as a friend, enable him to change his own orientation. he has to find the spark for that himself — has to let himself be changed by literature or philosophy or poetry or psychology or self-help. (i see it with these men, again and again.)
