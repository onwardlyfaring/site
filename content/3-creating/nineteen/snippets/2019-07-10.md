# july 10: restored

acceptance sits in my limbs. i can feel my arms and my legs, supple and strong; and i move with grace. i am in step with myself. it’s a new feeling, and a good one.

he and i spoke. a fountain in a park in the boston summer; a wednesday afternoon. he does not have empathy. but the breeze in the summer air was pleasant, and i felt calm and resolute. i do not need empathy from him. distance is the appropriate thing to have from him, and i have it. i can see that now.

you come to the point of understanding and you stop. he does not understand; i do not have the urge to make him understand. i’m out. i don’t think he’s a bad person, but i think he is missing something important, and that something is something i will not give up. if i have not been open with him, there is a reason.

afterwards, i feel whole; my spine straightened. i sit alone on a bench in boston common, and i am a daytimer among the daytimers. there’s shade and it smells like hotdogs and as i leave i give a dollar to an old man playing what i think is an erhu. it is july; and here i am, in july.
