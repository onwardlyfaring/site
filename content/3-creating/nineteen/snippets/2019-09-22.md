# september 22: finitude

to be finite. —

in math, a balancing point. not zero, not infinity. a confluence of factors; that settle just right. two, or seven, or twelve. how marvelous it is, that there is anything we can measure at all.

it comes to a rest. not divine, not damned. something-in-between. it goes, and it comes to a rest. two weeks, or seven months, or twelve years. decelerating; till it comes to a rest; not suddenly; not dramatically; but solidly. you can call it anticlimactic, or you can all it wholehearted. — something human; in human proportions.

your feelings human, in human proportions. a world you build for yourself; at scale.
