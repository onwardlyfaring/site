# september 16: mistakes about belief

maybe sometimes you have to hear yourself say something out loud and hear how stupid it sounds, before you can believe that you don’t actually believe it.

sometimes you get the distinct feeling that you’re thinking about something wrong. and sometimes your gut really does have an opinion which is right — the base-level thought, or your reflection on it. i can’t promise myself i should always trust my gut. but, truth be told, i’m not really sure what better options are.

sometimes i think the tendencies of my gut; are the only tendencies that are constitutive of me.
it is a bad situation, to have strongman’d one side, and strawman’d another. it’s something to avoid. and it’s the kind of thing your gut — in all its unreliability — might not catch. but i’m at a loss for another answer, than to check to make sure, that anyone you think is unreasonable and unthoughtful, you /really/ think is unreasonable and unthoughtful.

it’s great and all to be rational. but, what are you being rational about?
