i have been biding here for autumn. the turn of the season allows a turn in my head. i’ve been looking forward to the quiet.

the semester started. it’s serious in a way summer is not, and i’m glad. i’ve been yearning for the serious. waiting for restraint and cold days. already darkness creeps up earlier and earlier. — the melancholy is public but not communal, i wrote, late september of my freshman year.  

but it’s not autumn yet. there’s no melancholy, as it were. it is midnight and i am walking along mass ave and i am awake. some kids are climbing up the brick wall of the chapel; but nothing could be irreverent, now; nor nothing reverent. it’s a saturday night in the gap of asynchrony, school has started and it’s summer, and the kids are wearing sweatshirts, and i’m wearing corduroys, and everyone is still glad to be back, parties on dorm row.

there’s an edge to me in the autumn, and it’s coming. an edge i know well; but never without the melancholy. yet here i am. i am taking up space and i feel bold in the night.
