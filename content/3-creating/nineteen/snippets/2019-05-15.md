in a certain kind of melancholy, i diverge from my usual routes as i walk through campus. the mit buildings are a strange sprawl — corridors, niches, turns, all connected together. as a freshman, some winter evenings i would just wander. watch the paint change and the light fixtures change; see how the pipes connect together and take stock of the different stairwells; delight in the surprises —  a skull in the floor, thoughtful words scrawled on a chalkboard or a wall; displays that look more like art than science. how much there is to see, here. you can get lost in the tangle of it all: you can lose yourself in the tangle it all.

when i feel a little down, or a little reflective, or that pineapple-tinged sadness, and i am walking through mit: i see doors i have never walked through before, and i enter them. walk through hallways and stairwells different from any i have been in before. learn a little more about the guts of this school.

it makes this place seem big. you see machinery for high-level research and delivery notices and the offices of administrative departments that have no bearing on undergraduate life. mostly, the hallways are empty: it is the shell (or is it the exoskeleton?) of this place, and you are anonymous, when you wander within it.
