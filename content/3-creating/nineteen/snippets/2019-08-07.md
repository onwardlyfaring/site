# august 7: architectural space, real space

outside; and you feel like you’re in a synthetic architectural visioning photo. (all the cars, the same car; everything a little too perfect.) — the space stone and pristine and the trees manicured: this was a space constructed; and its construction, not its use, is what is salient.

yet in its perfect rendering in actuality, it serves its function well; and we sit outside. it’s all quiet and beautiful and elevated and clean. a place to talk.

watch the light change as the sun goes down. see the streetlights reflect in her glasses. and there it is and it’s raw and it’s connection; relevant and human and helpful and real.

i don’t know if the designed space is too slick; but i know our inhabitation of it had the friction of friendship.
