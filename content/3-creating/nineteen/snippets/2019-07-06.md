spend the day crying intermittently. don’t pretend everything is okay. i’m here and i’m low but at least i’m still feeling. — better than last time. i’m still whole.

a day of deep breaths and slow movements. take a walk. try to feel normal again. activity helps. read a children’s book you loved when you were young. sew some hexagons and listen to your older sister’s music from 2015. try to release some of the tension your body is still gripping. relax.

it works. a day; a soft day. i have so much respect for this body of mine. i will listen when she has something important to tell me. i know her patterns, now; i am not incomprehensible to myself. i will take my body seriously. i will take myself seriously.

some experiences spark you to contemplation: they direct your thinking. but i’d already had the experience that directed my thinking in this way. i already knew what it is i would have learned. still— there was a shift inside me, today. a shift in feeling, rather than thinking; a shift in conviction, rather than opinion. a shift in priorities. i’m sweet on my way to behavioral change.

it is evening, and i am proud of myself, that i remained intact this whole day long. i am aware of the wholeness of myself more than ever; and i can feel hope radiating through me.
