# july 25: sinful & ethical

practice diaphragmatic breathing as if it’s gonna help you. tell yourself it’s not your fault. better trust that tragedies are possible. it’s not about ethics, and it’s not about blame.

something’s been troubling me, these last days. maybe two things. turbulence in the mind is turbulence in the body, and i can feel it. still don’t understand myself. but i’m getting there. i always know i’m getting somewhere when i find myself in tears. that point where the emotional meets the somatic; on the other side. by compass or by will-o’-the-wisp, i’m moving.

i am cradling a want of kindness. something in me yearning for, and something in me grieving, a kindness i was not shown. it’s an absence that stands forth. and it may be an absence i can explicate: but this is not a moment for explication. i ache; and i am trying to recognize, i ache.

maybe sin need not have an ethical edge. (“sins known and unknown,” we repeat.) — i missed the mark. certainly he and i both were sinning against this body of mine. that i don’t deny. (sins known and unknown, we confess.) playing by the book does not guarantee welfare. courtesy still can be sin.

there’s a light in you. i’d better see it and greet it. i’d better treat you as a child of god; with kindness. i have to try.
