# september 25: recognize shared history

finally, the edge taken off. i sat down; and for the first time, i felt recognized. the change almost imperceptible — he said hello like he was saying hello to me.

it was relieving in a way i hadn’t expected. it serves both of us well, to put from mind our shared history. but i am coming to see, there are spots of discomfort in ignoring histories completely. there is a tension in acting as if you do not know someone, when you do know them. and it is a relief to relax from the pretense — even if the change in behavior is only slight.

this is what i am learning. to see someone after a relationship has ended, is not the same as to see someone before a relationship has ever begun. even when time has passed, or the other has changed, or not much ever happened anyways — still there is a weight you carry with you. sometimes it’s subtle. but it matters, that it is there. and while sometimes it may be appropriate to ignore completely: the disregard is a tactic for navigating the situation, not a consequence of the situation itself.

it takes time to let one’s heart soften. to re-encounter someone, in a new light. it’s awkward — the mismatch between what you know of someone, and how now you need to see them. but it smooths out, in time. you negotiate your role, you find yourself within it; and you find the other within theirs. the edge fades.
