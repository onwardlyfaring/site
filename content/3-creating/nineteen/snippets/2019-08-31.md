## august 31: year of moderation

i hoped that 2019 would be a year of moderation. that what i had avoided entirely out of unendorsed fear, i might step into thoughtfully; and what i spiral into too quickly, i would be able to control. it is one thing to make good decisions when you have already rigidly pre-committed yourself to the good decision. what i hoped to learn, is how to make good decisions while being flexible and proactive. to be able to evaluate how i was feeling about a situation, from inside of it, and to act accordingly.

it’s been going okay, i think. i’m getting better at leaving contexts i have no desire to be in, as soon as i realize that i really don’t want to be there any more; i’m getting better at realizing i don’t want to be in the contexts i in fact don’t want to be in. it’s not perfect, but it’s getting there. i can feel my own autonomy smooth within me. and — there are some contexts i still feel uncertain whether i can navigate well: but i have a better sense of what those are, and i feel aware and tentative within them; and that’s progress, i have to count.

i am proud of myself when i set boundaries that i mean.
