## july 20: uncover & correct mistaken habits

some days i come across a different way i have sinned, and i feel relieved.

this business of trying-to-stand-in-right-relation is difficult. there’s a lot to figure out about the world and about myself, to learn how to orient myself. sometimes i recognize that i simply do not know well enough; and i can feel myself swivel, like a compass confused. but sometimes i am oriented, and i am moving forward, and it has all been working well-enough, till finally i find: this is not the way i want to be living. sometimes those realizations are big. oftentimes they are small. always, i feel strangely glad. — because, once i’ve realized there’s something that needs to change, i can go about changing it. — because, once i see my mis-orientation, i can re-orient. — because something was a little off, under the surface the whole time, and now i have the chance to smooth it out, a bit.

there’s room to feel both embarrassed about the mistake and glad that i have found it and can start to correct it; the way soreness can both hurt and remind you that you’re getting stronger.
