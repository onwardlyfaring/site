# september 26: growing by pretending

you come to know something about yourself. put on a hat and play pretend and ask yourself how you feel. are you joyful, did it hurt, is this who you want to be next?

pretense in your own voice. it sounds like you.

is it you?

is it who you will be? — activity shapes identity, identity constitutes activity, what does god think of who you are becoming?

move forward.

move forward fast. you can’t outpace god. shut your eyes and move forward. you can’t get rid of god. shut your eyes and move forward. you can’t get rid of yourself.

pretense is the only kind of education i can stomach. identity dissolves at the slightest tap. i am blind and ready.
