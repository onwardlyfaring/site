they’re waxing the floors. navigate, re-navigate. it is nighttime and it is raining. chairs line the hallway, and you know there is a classroom, empty; a shell of a classroom; and you pass it by. it isn’t a classroom, with no desks and no chairs and no projector. it isn’t a classroom, gutted. (this school isn’t itself, gutted. you aren’t yourself, gutted.)

it is nighttime and it is raining and there is a quiet in your heart and a tired in your eyes. i’ve gotten to know the basements better, in these last days. course-correct on these twists and turns, in among the cement. grey, grey, all grey.

this morning i woke up motivated. — ready to go, a to-do list in my head, and i was filled with the will to accomplish these tasks. and you go and you go and there are errands and you are busy. but then it’s eight or nine pm and you look up at the stranger you’ve been talking to and you wonder what the hell you’ve been doing all day. and the colors are wrong and the logistics are wrong and the conversation is wrong and it is time to reach out to the people who matter. and evening subsides into night; and it begins to rain.

a summertime rain, in the night. it cleans you off. re-sets the tone. there’s space for sanctity in a summertime rain. space to feel. sometimes it’s okay to get a little wet.
