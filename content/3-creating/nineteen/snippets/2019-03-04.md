# march 4: reasons & gut, unaligned

some actions i make with full force of will: i understand what i am doing and why i am going it. there are reasons motivating me, and there is gut feeling motivating me, and intuition and intellect are in alignment, and it all glows out from me. it is reassuring to be in this state: a gut feeling was explained by reasons, or reasons convinced gut, and now i am going forward, solid and whole.

but sometimes it is time to act, but your reasons and your gut are not in alignment. sometimes you are confused: your heart pulls you one way, but rationality pulls you another, and you have to ask yourself the balance — do you really believe the frameworks you have used? do you understand the magnitude of what you are about to do? are you simply feeling stubborn?

— but sometimes, you are not confused. sometimes you are convinced you know what you need to do next. you are resolute.

often, this seems to happen when you have reasons, but you don’t know what they are, yet. it is scary to follow through on those hidden reasons; you do not know if they are reasons you really endorse; you do not know if your action is really the best way of responding to those reasons.

but when push comes to shove: just because you cannot articulate reasons, doesn’t mean you don’t have them. — doesn’t mean you shouldn’t act upon them.
