# march 31: probabilistic richness of human life

there is such richness to human life. reflect on your friends, on the people around you: what traits, what layerings of traits, do these dear ones exhibit, that you could not have conceived of before you met them? what of the tapestry of humanity is revealed to you through these friends? sometimes i am stopped short by the complexities of human lives. what ways, what strange and different and numerous ways, do people move through this world!

the richness gives me hope. sometimes it seems like there are parts of us that only god could hold. maybe that’s right, and maybe it’s not, but when i look out at these details of human life, i think: perhaps there’s someone not too far from here, who could handle this part of me. it doesn’t matter that i cannot conceive of how such a person would be; there are so many people, existing in so many ways, whose being in the world i could not have conceived of before i met them.

the plurality of human existence is not merely aesthetic: it hits the soul, and can sustain and heal.
