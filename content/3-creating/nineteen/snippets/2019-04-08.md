## april 8: grey-blue light

a grey-blue light filters in through the window, and i can see the soft outlines of the things resting in my room. a raincoat, slung on the back of a folding chair. a table. a picasso print — blue, although one couldn’t tell in this light. cords snaking from an outlet. an open notebook. it is night, and the lights are turned off, though it is not yet time to sleep. it’s a space familiar in the dark.

i lie on the bed, one knee bent. my hands rest on my chest, clasped around the now-dark outline of my phone. i can feel my heart beating.

it’s just that. a heartbeat. right where it is supposed to be: a quiet rhythm in my chest. dup-dup. dup-dup. dup-dup.  

i thought of you. with enough time, enough forgetting, enough early mornings and late nights in this quiet room when everything is sacred, you have become an eddy of soft words and gestures, more poem than person. i want to see you again; i want to see you in your roughness. i am not afraid of forgetting i do not love you. but i am afraid of forgetting i have never loved you.

this morning, a grey-blue light filtered in through the window, and i sat in a folding chair at the table, reading hume as i ate breakfast. cold, sweet. it was seven in the morning, and everything was quiet, and i could hear the drizzle of rain outside. everything was grey-blue and full of the morning.

fluid reading, heart beating. there’s a familiarity in your own pulse, in your own literacy. you can’t notice it too closely it or breaks in front of you. it takes that grey-blue light for me to see it. a quiet awareness that isn’t awareness at all. gratitude for the pulling-back.

solitude has crystallized in me, these last months. is any feeling good or bad? the soft and the harsh. the intense and the quiet. the sacred.

i don’t miss you. i have missed myself. but i’ve found the grey-blue light. i’ve found the familiarity.
