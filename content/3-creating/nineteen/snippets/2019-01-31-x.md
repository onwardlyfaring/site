<!-- # january 31: january is liminal -->

sometimes, changes happen fast. — the snap of a perspective, and suddenly everything is focused differently.

but often, shifting phases takes time. a realization that something is coming to an end, or that something new is on the horizon; a vague sense of what might constitute an appropriate change; the slow implementation of this change; the adjustment of one’s life to make space for it, building new habits and pruning old expectations. the process is gradual, and sometimes messy.

january always seems to be subsumed by one of these liminal stretches, and this year was no different. closure on relationships past; a new understanding of how to hold myself; the strange ephemera (and the strange phenomenological experience of this time they bring), rising and falling as they do within this span of instability.

but i am getting there. i am starting to realize just how much the experience of living my life has changed over these last weeks. quietly — i think that these seeds planted in december, which took root when i was home, and sprouted once i got back to school — i think these little plants might be nearing maturation. i am excited for the semester to begin, not because there is anything in particular i am looking forward to, but because i will be glad to allow this new chapter to blossom out in me.
