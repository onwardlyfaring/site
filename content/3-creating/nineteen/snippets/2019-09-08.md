# september 8: suborder blattodea, order dictyoptera

i find two of their carcasses buried among the shoelaces of my boots. the bodies look like living bodies, but motionless; still. the brown-mechanical movement of legs and antennas gone.

we lived together, this summer — me and the bugs. always on the cream wall by the sink there would be one; some compact body, shiny and coppery and precise. they would crawl and they would stop and their limbs were slender and strong. i didn’t mind the bugs, this summer. we lived together.

one day i put duct tape on the corner of molding with cracks those leathery bodies would sometimes disappear into. i’m not sure what i wanted. but when i came back from work, one of the bugs had gotten stuck on the tape; accidentally, i had left part of the adhesive exposed. the bug was trying to move but couldn’t; antenna still probing. i did nothing but my heart sank.

you wake up morning after morning and you see a bug dying. still alive; but slowly starving; thin-slender limbs still moving. one morning i killed it. i felt sharp and uneasy.

the dynamic has changed, between me and the bugs. i put more tape up; more bugs died. the first two were accidents, the next two were traps. others i have smashed myself. (a knot rises in my chest.) those scuttling bodies are pests, now; a problem perhaps i need to call someone about.

it makes me sad. i am territorial and uneasy. i still admire them, wings folded tightly on their backs.
