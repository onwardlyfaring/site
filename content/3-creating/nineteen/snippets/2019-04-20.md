# april 20: the wind on my face like a blessing

i could feel the wind on my face like a blessing. soft, gusty: and the disquiet caked on my skin was blown right off, and it dissolved into the open springtime air and disappeared. it was the kind of wind that follows a drizzle and accompanies it, that reminds you of the sacred in the grey. and the boats tossed about on the water, and the water broke open, rough and silver, and you could hear it crashing against itself even from here.

our legs dangled over the ledge, and the wind brushed against the tops of my feet, and i looked at you. how much time i have spent sitting next to you. and sometimes we are quiet; and sometimes we speak. and you tell me again, you are curious to know my thoughts. you say again, you miss being inside my head. it is a statement, not a demand; and you are patient, so patient.

i exhale, my breath a small wind within the wind. is this what friendship is?

you were so full in that moment.
