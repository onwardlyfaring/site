## september 4: hard to hold as human

in general, i work to make sure that i see the people around me as human. there is so much to appreciate in people’s complexities and circumstances; and how important it is to remember that they have a will, and that that will matters; to remember that they are psychological, and sometimes that complication-to-will matters. — i try to orient around the world in light of these facts.

it’s hard to maintain uniformly. but usually, when i come to realize that i am failing to hold this posture, i want to and am able to shift into that posture, relatively quickly. with some deliberate thought, i remember to hold particular people i happen to find unpleasant, still as people; and if i fail in this shifting, i want to succeed.

but there are one or two scenarios, at the moment, in which that desire and ability has just — broken. i have lost sight of their humanity, and at the moment, i don’t particularly or actively want to bring that orientation back. my body still keeps exclaiming — rightly or wrongly — that there is subtle danger, when these people are near; and it’s hard to hold a hazard as human. it’s hard even to want to.

i hope, soon, that i will be able to restore humanity to my representations of these people. but i’m not there yet.
