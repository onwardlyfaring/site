# may 17: anger subsiding

and it subsides. there’s a rising in you, and it fills you; and your insides are sharp and fiery, like there’s a strange pale green inside of you. it is a reaction: it is a first-order emotion. there’s something relieving about feeling anything, pure and strong. so often, my emotions are a complicated heavy mix of feelings about feelings about feelings, and it’s all contradictory, and every emotion gets lost in the mix, because there’s too much to feel it all. so there’s something about just getting to be angry, for a moment or two. but it subsides.

there was a rising in me. it did not burst out of me, although, i say, it leaked out of my sides. and then a new wave rose within me; and the anger receded; and it was different inside of me. a letting-go, a mellowing. it may be relieving to feel anger: but i cannot hold that emotion for long, and perhaps i am glad of it. anger turns me inward; and though it is important to me to feel it (—the manifestation, that there is a boundary i need to protect or restore —) and to process it and to deal with it, i feel more human and more myself, when i can have just a little more of that outward turning.

it rose in me (so pure), and then it fell. perhaps it will come back tomorrow, in the progression of the waves. but is it not a relief, too, that this ocean is dynamic?
