# august 13: full-bodied // full-hearted

ate a sweet potato as a nighttime snack. a little salt, a little pepper; it’s warm and it fills you up inside. in the kitchen in socks; quiet strains of an owen pallet song; waiting for the microwave to beep; a new pink-orange shirt. if a sweet potato is sustenance, then i am well-sustained.

it was a comfort just to hear her voice, you know. half-laughs interwoven in her speech; and i could picture the quirking-back of a smile; her, full-bodied. i had been worried. but i’m not worried. we’ll face the future and move through it.

there was a new yorker article, last november, entitled, “the algorithmic emptiness of allbirds shoes.” and i laughed when i read it; because my strongest association with allbirds shoes, was with a man who sometimes seemed algorithmically empty. — as if he appreciated the items in his life in proportion to their technical excellence; without those little glints of fondness.

i do not feel algorithmically empty. i am full of sweet potato and platonic love.
