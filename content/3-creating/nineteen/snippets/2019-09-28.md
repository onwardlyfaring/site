# september 28: softness recovered

and so i find him human again. understanding and compassion recovered. i feel grateful to him.
sometimes it is hard to get from where you are to some other place. you look up and it’s just rock and mountain ahead of you. and you realize, if you aren’t going to stop in the face of it, you’re gonna have to go through it.

i went through it, this year. i went through it, and it was messy. rubble all around. tunnel precarious. i went through it, and sometimes i misstepped. sometimes i put my weigh in the wrong place, and rock came crumbling down behind me. it was dark, and i caused trouble. i made mistakes on that journey.

they’re mistakes i have to atone for. i don’t repent that i traveled from where i was to this other place, and i see that the trip was always going to be treacherous. but i regret this rock crumbling. i repent of the missteps. (sins known and unknown, i recognize.) — i apologize to him. i feel raw.

something inside of me softens. i finally break out of my own head. to wrong and to be wronged. it all seems more comprehensible, now. there are standards i need to hold myself to. i admire him so much.

and so we keep learning to hold each other as human.
