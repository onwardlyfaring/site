after feeling empty, i feel full. take a walk outside in the darkness, and it’s sprinkling; and it feels like every raindrop splashes a freckle onto my face. on this drizzly night, i feel sun-kissed.

i miss the girl who was me two years ago with the same affection one might have for a childhood friend. i stand outside at the bench and the arching statue she loved, and i remember. i remember her standing out here one warm may day, and i remember her reckoning with herself. later, i would think that mit felt most like my campus when i walked through it late at night hand in hand with him. but before that, this place was mine on that spring night when i stood outside and leaned my back against the alexander calder stabile, listening to owen ashworth songs and growing up.

tonight, i nestle into the stabile again. it is tall and solid and grounding, and i understand why that girl who was me was so drawn it. even though time has passed and a story has ended and i have changed, i feel at home. i run my hand over the dark painted steel, and i am a little boy in a picture book who has a dragon for a friend.

i beam and cry at the same time. there’s something heartening in nostalgia.
