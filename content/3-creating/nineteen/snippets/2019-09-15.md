when i think of you, i think of us together, in comfortable silence.

it is the equilibrium point of my memory and imagination of you, i guess — that comfortable quiet. to be sitting or walking or reading with you, speaking little; but here and there catching your eye; or feeling your hand in my hand.

i think sometimes i say more than i mean, when i speak. i think sometimes i feel tired of myself and behind myself, when i try to articulate anything at all. it is a relief to think of not saying too much around you. i felt well-matched to you. — silly as it was, i felt well-matched to you.

it may be true that there were problems. it may be true that despite how little we spoke, still we said too much. and it may be true that keeping silence is just a way of hiding from oneself. yet here it is. there is a kind of relaxed embodiment of self i feel when i am alone; that i otherwise have only felt so purely, in moments with you.

it’s not so much that i miss you, as that i hold such moments with you, with fondness in my memory; like little forget-me-not flowers, blooming quiet-blue, stem between my fingertips.
