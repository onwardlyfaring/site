# september 9: anxiety from a re-encounter

my body feels tense and electric again. heavy-solid-stressed; like a swarm of bees trying to break apart yet held together, by some strange and straining force. at first i’m not sure where it’s coming from. but then i shake my head: there it is. a worry not on the usual list of suspects; an understandable worry; yet also one that need not overtake me. — tomorrow i will be asked to be vulnerable in a space i’m not quite comfortable being vulnerable in. the situation sucks, but the stakes are low. and truth be told, i am not terribly concerned, not on reflection. i go to class to learn, not to already know. it will be okay.

breathe in, breathe out. it has come to amaze me, in these last months, how quickly and intensely i can come to feel in my body even small worries; and how long the tension can linger there in my limbs. emotion gets physicalized so much sometimes i don’t even feel it as emotion. i don’t like it. breathe in, breathe out. i start to trace through myself; note after note of self-compassion. sometimes i have to face physical problems with mental work; sometimes it helps to face mental problems with physical work; but here there is tension in my body, and i am telling this body, how much i love her. i will let myself relax.

it helps, you know. breathe in, breathe out. i am in a different place than once i was.
