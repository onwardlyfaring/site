<!-- # january 21: fight with defeatism -->

to set your expectations low is different than to set your credence in the good thing low.

when the administration is threatening those things you — and the larger community community — and you believe, the whole institution insofar as it includes a vibrant undergraduate population — hold dear, you fight. you dialogue and you discuss and you workshop under the constraints which have been given to you, and finally you realize, this reasoned conversation is mere facade, and it’s time to stop reserving our power for farcical negotiation. we’re going to do what we can. and if it doesn’t work? we’re going to go down fighting. fighting as upstanding citizens. fighting while holding ourselves to the highest standard of moral excellence. fighting for the life and vibrance of this place.

we’re not quite to that point yet, here at MIT. but we’ve got to figure out where our boundaries are & what we’re going to do if they get crossed.

it doesn’t matter if we embrace defeatism: we still will fight. heck, defeatism can be emboldening. protest can be expression, not pressure: we need not be consequentialists.

hold tight. fight the good fight.
