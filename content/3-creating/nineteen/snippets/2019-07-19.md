## july 19: healing trauma

singularity. division by zero: the ground is no ground. (a brokenness to the surface of your consciousness.) it’s pitch-black and endless, down there. throw a pebble in and it will disappear.
(if your stomach doesn’t churn, to stare down into that deep-empty dark: you’re missing a self-preservation instinct.)

don’t fall in! not again. — be wary. (it is easier than you think to fall in, and it is harder than you think to get out.)

till finally you can re-orient yourself. till you’re not staring out at the gaping opening; till you find yourself looking at the diaphanous, funnel-like outline of that boundless hole from the side. it’s then (courageous, frustrated) you can reach out & grasp that long stem & knot it, tight; and suddenly the infinite is finite. give it time. that dangling matter will fall off. and once it heals, you’ll be left only with the aberration of a navel: a new mark of independence. you might stumble over that little crater, but you won’t plummet. it will be good enough.

you don’t have to be perfectly smooth, friend. you’ve been places. if there’s a tripping hazard or two on your psyche, so it goes. you don’t have to be perfectly smooth.
