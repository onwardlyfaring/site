## august 15: self-compassion while dissociative

i slipped today. i was down; like the server for the online experiment platform was down. this site can’t be reached.

it felt like i had crawled in through myself; a whole layer of mental processing inaccessible. and my eyes couldn’t quite hold focus; and my body was resistant to movement. i used to be scared of myself, in times like those. used to push; used to try to will myself to break through it completely; used to get frustrated and upset when i failed. nothing is wrong; so why am i stuck here? — that was the question from which a static panic would bloom.

but i am gentler with myself, now. with familiarity and compassion: even if i am thinking from under myself, there is a care for self still, which has seeped in; and i am patient with myself. i know myself. i can relax within it. and calmness enables steps to be taken. i do not need to prevail on myself. i know what is going on. i will move through this also. — that is the awareness from which i move forth.

i slipped today. i was down; like the server for the online experiment platform was down. — for a short time; in a way not too inconvenient. and then i found my way back up, and i caught hold again. i am not afraid of myself.
