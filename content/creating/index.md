## projects, finished and in progress

### on growing up: projects from college 
- [exploring the neighborhood](/exploring-the-neighborhood): a senior year essay. written for a literature class on nature writing that became the central activity of my life when the pandemic hit; about annie dillard and the town i grew up in and birds and what it means to be human.
- [snippets](/nineteen): junior year collection of little pieces. every day january-september 2019 i wrote a few hundred words of creative non-fiction and posted it on my [instagram](https://instagram.com/onwardlyfaring). 
- [drupelets](/drupelets): sophomore year newsletters. the original source of the blackberry drawing used on this site. i wrote issues anonymously and would drop ~30 paper copies in the hallways of mit each tuesday night.
- semester i & semester ii: freshman year zines. included not because i am proud of them (indeed, it is uncomfortable to look back on them!) but to honor what it was to be seventeen and overwhelmed and trying to figure things out.
